            <h2>About Julia Hester</h2>
            <p>
                Ms. Julia Hester, born on August 10, 1928 in Palmetto, Florida, was the daughter of Preston and Lania Hester. She was the
                sixth of seven children.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1948, Ms. Hester was married to the late Louchis Hogan, Sr. To this union, five children were born. In 1960, she was married
                to the late Juan Ocasio. To this union, two children were born. The family lived in Miami and New York City,
                where Ms. Hester continued her education at the Baby and Geriatric Career Institute of New York and the University
                of the State of New York. She worked at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital in New York City until her retirement
                to Atlanta, where she continued to take care of her family and GlobalTech Financial, a family business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ms. Hester had many interests. However, above all, she loved her family, the Braves, cooking, fishing, her soaps, and the
                slots. She was an avid reader and sometimes read a book a week. She also loved her church. Before she became
                very ill, she was an active member of Sharon United Medothist Church in Dunwoody, Georgia.
            </p>

                Where I have gone I am not so small. My soul is as wide as the world is tall. I have gone to answer the call, the call Of
                the One who takes care of us all. Wherever you look, you will find me there &#45; In the heart of a rose,
                In the heart of a prayer. On butterflies&#39; wings, on wings of my own, To you, I'm gone, But I'm never
                alone.
                <br />I am home
